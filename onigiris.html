                <h3>- Instructions:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Wash the rice with water in a strainer until it runs clear.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Put the water and rice in a saucepan. Then bring to a boil on high until the boiling water is about to come out.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Once you've reached this point, turn off the heat. If there is still water left, set it to a minimum for a little longer.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Once the fire is out, let it rest for about 10 minutes. During the entire process of cooking and resting the rice, preferably the lid should not be removed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Once the 10 minutes are up, remove the lid and let it sit for another 5-10 minutes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Once the preparation of the rice is finished, it is left in a bowl covered with a damp cloth so that it does not dry out until it cools.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Meanwhile, heat the water and salt in a saucepan until dissolved.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When the salt water cools, dip your hands in it so that the rice does not stick to us when working with it.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p> Prepare the different types of fillings that we want to taste.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>To add the filling, put a good spoonful of rice on one hand. Put the filling in the center of it. Next, you will have to finish forming the ball completely covering the filling.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Finally, it is given a triangular shape (with rounded corners). It is necessary to consciously press the ball so that it remains very compact.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Once this is done, place a small sheet of nori underneath, which will make it easier to handle.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
